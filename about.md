You are reading Alexandre Girard's website (Alex for short). I love computers since very young. Our second computer home was a pentium 1, 166 MHz. How relevant is this ? Who cares. Just know that I am 100% involved in the things I am doing. I'm enthusiastic by nature, and got cranky when I'm not fed.

I've started paying taxes in January 2008. More details in my [Résumé](/resume/) and [linkedin](http://lnkd.in/dGkses).
