You are reading Alexandre Girard's website. I love computers since very young. My family (right...) second computer was a pentium 1, 166 MHz. How relevant is this ? Who cares. Just know that I am 100% involved in the things I am doing. I'm enthusiastic by nature, and got cranky when I'm not fed.

You might wonder... Okay. I've started officially my working experience in January 2008. There is hips of details on [linkedin](http://lnkd.in/dGkses). I'll do a good looking timeline and post right here soon enough.
