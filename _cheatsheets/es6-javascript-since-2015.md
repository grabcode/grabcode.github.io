## ES6 or Javascript 2015

Javascript is a fantastic and popular language. As such, it evolves rather quickly and new functionalities  are brought to Javascript programers very often, thanks to Ecma International, institution driving this upgrades.

Lately, in year 2015, the new specifications have been [signed off](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html), and Consequently what was named ES6 became officially ES2015. Any further development of Ecma would fall under the code name of ES7.

We are going to concentrate onto ES6 features, and eventually bring the most widely accepted ES7 along.
