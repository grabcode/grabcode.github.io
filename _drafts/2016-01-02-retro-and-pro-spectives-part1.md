I wanted to share a

Some say you should go out of your comfort zone to grow and eventually bloom. It did worked for me.

I have diving into new stuff in 2015. Late 2014, I've left my sweet Angular/Grunt world to dive into the depth of a completely new stack. Fortunately I've been lucky to find a great team of smart people at Practice Ignition (one of them works at Google now!). Actually, the whole company is full of amazing and performant people, not just the product dev gang.

Among the new things I had to learn quickly.

[x] Rails
[x] CoffeeScript
[x] Backbone (that I knew a little)
[x] Marionette

What I can say about that? The communities and documentations are great. This technologies are mature and it felt really good whenever I've faced difficulties

Workflow and methodologies
[x] Tests, some sort of mixture BDD nor TDD
[x] Git, with "Gitflow" then "Github flow"
[x] Code review through Pull Requests

I wasn't really experienced working with this versioning systems/methodologies. And after and sometimes still through a steep learning curves, I've . I would say the hardest part was to follow a rather strict discipline allowing you to avoid most of the obstacles you would have otherwise.

[x] D3.JS

Also, late 2015 I've got the opportunity to learn and use D3.JS. Man that was tough to start with, since I had really neither use SVG nor Drawing library. Until then, I was pleased to rely on someone else graph library, such as Raphael, or a well crafted jquery graph plugin.

In term of achievements, I tried more or less successfully to push the team toward a more open source approach. It is a challenge for a tiny team of people meant to firstly focus on a product used by hundreds and soon thousands of companies.

For now, I've just shared a moment.js extension [moment.period](https://github.com/PracticeIgnition) dedicated into translating time period into human language and vice-versa. Btw, I must thank [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds) for this great [online tutorial](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-write-an-open-source-javascript-library).

I'm a member of [MarionetteLabs](https://github.com/MarionetteLabs), where I intend to continue on my experimentations [Marionette.ViewTags](https://github.com/grabcode/marionette.viewtag). In a nutshell I want to expose Marionette Views as HTML tags, similarly to components in React or directive in Angular.

Besides this work done during day light, I've also progressed on another project using MeteorJS. I've created from scratch `Quadrant`, a SaaS for brands to primarily produce garment spec sheets. I actually have more to say about that project in the next blog post.

I have been also teaching a lot more at General Assembly. It's been a [great experience](http://grabcode.fr/misc/2015/05/15/the-teaching-vertical/) although it's tiring a lot. I plan on slowing down teaching beginners HTML/CSS/JS courses, and move to some more advanced topics such as React or Backbone or Angular...

A little more blogging... I'm guilty of lazy blogging. I must have 30 articles sitting in my draft folder at the moment. That's a pity. Publishing half of them would be a good resolution for 2016.

Oh, I almost forgot. I've welcomed my second son, Gabriel, born the 26th of July. While my second son , Matisse, has reached his 2nd year. What is said is true, it is a crazy period. Fortunately my wife have done a tremendous work, while continuing on studying her MBA in Finance and Economy. God I love this woman. What would be Men without Women, I fear to ask. Note: the reciprocal question works the same. Anyway, I look forward spending more quality time with my sons. I've been playing with them much more since we moved close to the beach, and I intend on increasing it. Work means a lot to me, but family will always comes first.

One last thing; I ran Tough Mudder Sydney, and I'm back into surfing. I've realized how much the spirit cannot rest if the body is not exhausted.
