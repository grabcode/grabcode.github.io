They are amazingly scared about small businesses. I'd call that the Goliath and David syndrom.

They have a monopole, and they did came out

Tech startup are pretty much baby crocodile. And what does a crocodile do ? It eats the baby. We call ourself civilized people, with a lot of proudness. And the meantime, we copy wild nature system. We need to drop either the title of civilized and accept our barbarianism, or we have to evoluate.

How ? For me, the key is a better richness repartition. A logarithmic approach instead of the current exponential. Anyone can become infinily rich, but the more you want, the harder it must become, constantly.

Treshold? Hard to define.
Another issue to address: patrimoine (legacy).

Indeed we must admit that we never left the lords and kings kind of wealth repartition. .3% dominates, hence control, 99.7%. 

Uber banned us.

Apple forbidding other stores (while not the case on android). Protect you ? Is your name Candide ? AHAH, what a fool you make. Pure business $$ decision.
