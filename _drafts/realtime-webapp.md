Business wise: talk about pivots

Backseat post part 2

backseat, bapteme du feu pour mon dev.

realtime: web socket

1st thing: what options remains technically. Websocket requires async messaging. Hence no threaded solution, such as Java, PHP, Ruby...

Use what I love, to lean more easily waht I don't know precisely. I end up using a full javascript stack.

Choosing carefully the tech stack (language, framework...)  Community and Support are key

Phonegap, Angular

Node.js with SailsJS. No meteor, yet. Too much of a black box. Plus, back then, there was no officially supported way to integrate with Phonegap. Some hacky version were existing though. But not reliable enough of an entreprise grade app.
