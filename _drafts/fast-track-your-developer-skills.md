In my career, I've 2 bold and retrospectively smart moves. I've started to invest into Javascript quickly (in 2009), and I've bet early on Angular at the right time (0.6.x) and Meteor.

Before that, I was a shitty developer. I didn't know much about anything, except maybe in PHP. Hell, I wasn't even clear why so much people loved OO languages like Java. Back then, I was always more interested into high level explanation and theorical knowledge. And then I've started to work on some very real problems, in some very serious companies. Unfortunately, or not, I didn't follow the normal dev way. I mean, I didn't join de dev team. I've started writing some XSL and regex, and a bot would use to crawl merchant website. The great thing though is I had the opportunity to develop very strong soft skills. I was facing different people as I was always on the top layer of the dev stack.

Anyhow, I've realised how much unsatisfied I was. My hunger and my thirst started to raise. I wanted more. More understanding on how things worked, more control on my professional life.

Why has it been a good choices? How did I made this calls? Can I "force the luck" again?

Start investing time into technological watch
Work on your own time, and I'd recommend to work on someone else project (business wise)
Dive into open source
Contribute into documentation
Try edge technology
Start a blog, and do it for yourself first. As a journal of your experience or a way to right down what you've understood about something. Yes, you might wrong. But guess what who's even more wrong? The one who's writting anything. Better wrong than unknown (I've just made that up :D).

Start reading the source of the libraries you use. You don't have to read it like a book, from top to bottom, but more by api. Stop relying solely on the actual doc, when you have some. It could be outdated, or simply not finished. Plus, you'll get a chance to learn from your peers. libraries and framework, especially open sourced, are often written and maintain by the best out there. You'll learn some tricks, ways to write things. But more importantly, it will eventually build your confidence, and you'll start to realize that those peers are not that far from you.

Warning! you cannot catch every trains. This is very true in Web. The churn of libraries and framework is very high. Through you'll learn how to quickly identify what is worth learning, what is not. Until, I recommend to follow some people doing smart curation (such as myself :D).
