Blog GA part 2

My touch, mon empreinte

Talk about innovation introduce:
JavaScript as first class citizens (no jquery at first and no dom)
Github as a free hosting platform
Dev community

Main motive: make them independent (teaching how to be self taught), great self satisfaction (share there work online with friends and colleagues...) and keep their motivation up dipping into communities and meeting mentor to ignite their fire.


At GA, we run surveys methodically. I reckon that's one of the key reasons why GA is so successful.
Out of thoses surveys, we get ENS (??). Out of the one, it came out that students wanted cheatsheet. I've personally moved away from that since I'm using a lot the web to find the info. But it was clear that my students background needed to be considered to increase their ocnfort. After all they were already doing of effort. SO I did.
