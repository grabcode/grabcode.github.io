Following up with yesterday's article, I'd like to share my prospectives for 2016.

More challenge: I'm gonna co-found and lead the product dev.
I'm going to dive deeper and share my discoveries about
Dev tools
  debugger

Sinon/Chai
  spy
  stub
  clock

CoffeeScript to ES6
  in CS, you can (param) => {}, in ES6 you can param => {}

ES6 https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/07/es6-in-depth-let-and-const/
  Destructuring assignment
  template string
  var, let, const
    https://strongloop.com/strongblog/es6-variable-declarations/
  rest operator, argument spreading,
  Array... spread operator (Diarhea annotation)
  import/export
  class
  arrow function =>
  generators,
  promises,
  maps, sets,
  symbols,
  New apis:
    Object.assign, the new extend
    fetch, the new $.ajax

Functional programing
  Higher order function
    Pass function as argument
    > Composition
  Pure Function
  Immutability
  Reactive programing

Some application: React, React Native (some app being dev currently), Redux, Immutable.Js

Teaching through new mean: writing article, shooting videos, meetup, conference.
Some more Meteor
Way more blogging
Definitely more open source participation

Besides this technical challenge, I want to master my public speaking skills.

What I wish for 2016 is to become more pragmatic, focused and efficient. I still want to achieve a lot of things in parallel, and I really need to tweak up my methodology allowing me just that.

What I've identified: I should work from a quite place, preferably always the same place.
I shall put aside any social interaction, and avoid the trap of reading articles after articles when researching for info about tech or an issue. Procrastination takes many form, and seduce you taking the shape of "learning many diverse things is good for you".
Before any working session, take 15 to 30 minutes to define a step by step recipe to achieve the session goals.

technically
I'd like to create:
- Magento/Wordpress plugins
- Atom extension
- Extract to React Native adobe comet extension

Fit. I want to become fit again. I used to run a lot, and I've decided to take action and resume my workouts. Plus, now I've moved to Maroubra, I intend to become a good surfer.
