Startup weekend, and variants (SW Education)


A hackathon is challenging. A hackathon with a broken french-glish among Australian/New Zealand folks, hmmm. Language wise, the vocabulary was there, but you would believe me if I tell you how much I was tired to hear "what a beautiful accent". That's no use for me if you struggle understand !

And this hackathon quite different from the previous I've participated to. Firstly, I had to pay about $70 to participate. What the hell ? You don't pay to participate Hackathon in Europe, but you win really nice prizes when you win.
