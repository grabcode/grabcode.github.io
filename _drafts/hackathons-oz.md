Code road
Startup weekend, and variants (SW Education)


A hackathon is challenging. A hackathon with a broken french-glish among Australian/New Zealand folks, hmmm. Language wise, the vocabulary was there, but you would believe me if I tell you how much I was tired to hear "what a beautiful accent". That's no use for me if you struggle understand !

And this hackathon quite different from the previous I've participated to. Firstly, I had to pay about $70 to participate. What the hell ? You don't pay to participate Hackathon in Europe, but you win really nice prizes when you win.


Traffic killer hackathon

Intro
This weekend, the nsw codeworks hackathon (add link to what it is) was in Tank stream lab.

To participate we actually had to go through a selection. Though it was requiring time and effort I ve decided to apply feeling that this was another proof of the quality of this hackathon. stremseat project was launched. A transportation mode aggregator with a focus on social. Had to mention backseat.

Now let s face the delicate moment: The team. As member of the working force,  I knew it would be difficult to find skilled people crazy - meant motivated- enough to sacrifice a beautiful and preciius australian weekend (sun, beach and barbecue with other normal people). I ve seen an opportunity though. Indeed after my participation to the paypal hack, 2 of my colleagues seemed eager ti discover the thrilled of the hackathon for the 1st time. I usually  manage to convince 2 col since I knew they were curious s8nce last  It d be there 1st hackathon

Registration, getting tshirt and the coffee cup.

The organisator did a good job and obviously No traffic during the different steps, with a very well schedules pitch.

This sec5uon is called "Breaking my hackathon interest" or said softely "Time for my personal review"

The surprise would have be the LEAN startup canva, with an evaluation focusing on the business model instead of the announced user friendly design. Understand that it has been my 6th hackathon in sydney (mongodb, startup weekend, startup weekend education - iwon, gov hack - I ve left, paypal) and 4 of them required this, beg pardon, damn lean canvas shiit. Seriously, if you read this and intend to organize an hackathon, understand:
1. Lean startup isn t a solution for everything
2. Lean startup does require actually more than 2 days. Are you nuts ?
3. Solicitating devs, and designers for an unpaid work over the weekend require not only good barista and food, but FUN. Try print this in your mind.

That said, I was very happy to discover, learn and now master lean startup. My position had changed. Plus I won't quit my job even I win a hackathon thanks to a great slides prssentation and a good pitch.
